 * SGDMA Descriptor construction routines.

 * These routines construct a single SGDMA descriptor in the memory
 * pointed to in alt_avalon_sgdma-descriptor *desc.
 *
 * The completed descriptor is made ready to run by setting its "Owned
 * by HW" bit; once the SGDMA controller receives the descriptor (and
 * its RUN bit is asserted), the descriptor will be processed.
 *
 * The descriptor under construction's "next" value is set to the "next"
 * descriptor passed to this routine, but the "next" descriptor's "Owned
 * by HW" bit is explicitly negated; once the SGDMA completes processing of
 * *desc it will not continue to *next until it, too, is made ready. You
 * can subsequently call the appropriate descriptor construction routine
 * on *next to make it ready, too.
 *
 * You are responsible for the creation of both the descriptor under
 * constuction as well as the "next" descriptor in the chain.
 *
 * Important: descriptors must be in a memory device mastered by the SGDMA
 * controller's "chain read" and "chain write" Avalon master-ports. Care must be
 * taken to ensure that both *desc and *next point to areas of memory mastered
 * by the controller.
